# Crop-Yield-Prediction
Crop yield prediction is a crucial task for agricultural planning, resource allocation, and food security initiatives. By harnessing the power of machine learning, we can leverage historical data, weather patterns, and other relevant features to develop accurate predictive models.

In this machine learning project, we delve into the fascinating world of agriculture and data science to predict crop yields at a country level.we explore various machine learning techniques, such as regression models, time series analysis, and ensemble methods, to forecast crop yields for different countries. We discuss the importance of feature selection, data preprocessing, and model evaluation in achieving reliable and robust predictions. Additionally, we showcase the practical implementation of these techniques using popular machine learning libraries.
